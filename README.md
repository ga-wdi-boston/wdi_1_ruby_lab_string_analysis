## Assignment

Create these four methods on the `String` class. Run `rspec spec` to ensure that your methods properly return results. Fork/Clone and Pull Request when you're finished with the assignment. 

You should edit the `lib/string_analysis.rb` file to make the tests pass. 

If you should encounter bugs, use Github Issues to file a bug report, and then I can fix the bug. 

You'll now be able to call "foo bar".word_frequencies with these. On Friday, we'll see about how we can make our own Gem that will use these and other methods that we create.
